    <br>
    We are pleased to announce that Dr. Marc Vandemeulebroecke has recently been appointed as a visiting professor in the IQ Health Biostatistics Research and Education group. Dr. Vandemeulebroecke is a thought leader in quantitative methods with over 20 years of experience in drug development. 
    Trained as mathematician, statistician and pharmacometrician, he currently heads the Statistical 
    Innovation Group at the pharmaceutical company UCB. Throughout his career in the pharmaceutical industry, 
    he has engaged in methodological research in academic collaborations, and has supported development and approval 
    of numerous new medicines.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Biostatistics Research Group has a strong research portfolio on innovative methods in 
    clinical research for drug development and regulatory science. Dr. Vandemeulebroecke adds a 
    strong drug development perspective to this portfolio. His expertise will benefit the Radboudumc in 
    translating basic research findings into clinical practice, and aligns well with Radboudumc’s focus on rare diseases, 
    as he was one of the key industry collaborators in obtaining the INVENTS project (HORIZON-HLTH-2023-IND-06). 
    This project aims to innovate the use of advanced modelling to improve the design and value of clinical trials 
    in rare diseases and pediatrics.
    <br>
    <br>
    As part of his visiting professorship, Dr. Marc Vandemeulebroecke will contribute to the INVENTS project and 
    support dissemination and implementation of research results within the Radboudumc, especially for academic 
    drug development for rare diseases. He will be involved in teaching advanced (MSc) courses related to his area 
    of expertise. As Dr. Vandemeulebroecke puts it: “I look forward very much to contributing to the success of 
    the great IQ Health Biostatistics team at Radboudumc. I am a strong advocate for collaboration and exchange 
    between industry and academia, and this engagement will allow me to pursue this mission even further. 
    I am very grateful for this opportunity.”
