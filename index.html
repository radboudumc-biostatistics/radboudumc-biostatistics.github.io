      The Biostatistics research group is housed at Radboudumc (Nijmegen). It is part of the department of IQ Health. 
      Our core activities are Research, Education and Consultancy.
      We employ mathematical and statistical techniques to address research questions that range across various disciplines, such as
      clinical research and rare diseases, clinical trial designs, and dynamics of infectious diseases.

      We offer several courses on methodology. These are either part of the Biomedical Sciences master program at Radboudumc, or post-academic courses.
      Both are given by experts from our department.
      The group has a joint leadership role in the development of the Master Medical Data Science, where inferential statistics and epidemiology meet
       new developments in deep learning and AI.

      Beyond the focus and impact on research, the group also provides statistical support to internal researchers,
      internship students, and external interested parties. This is a joint force with the RTC Health Economics.
      On annual basis, we carry out around 400 short consultancies on research projects within Radboud UMC.
