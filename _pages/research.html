    <h4>Advanced modelling for longitudinal and survival data, including federated inference</h4>
    <p>Survival analysis is a branch of statistics in which one is interested in 
      the time to a specific event. Examples are the time to death after the diagnosis of cancer,
       or the time to recovery after a specific infection.</p>
