      <p>Veronica is a Postdoctoral researcher in the Biostatistics unit at Radboud UMC. Her research line focuses on the development of mathematical and statistical modelling to understand determinants and dynamics of infectious diseases in different endemic settings, with a keen interest in providing quantitative evidence to support decision making and guide public health interventions.  </p>
      <p> Her experience includes (stochastic) agent-based modelling, crucial to track individual heterogeneity in transmission dynamics, neglected tropical diseases (NTD) in low- and middle-income countries, and health equity. During her PhD, she had the opportunity to be part of the NTD Modelling Consortium and to contribute informing policy decisions concerning the control and elimination of soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis through quantitative modelling. 
        </p>
        <p>
        She is currently working as a mathematical modeller for the project <i>EQUalS: Mathematical modelling to inform an EQUitable and effective response to EpidemicS</i>, funded by the The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (ZonMw).
