            <strong>**Course registration: Statistics for Clinical Researchers:**</strong> Are you involved in clinical research and do you feel the need to update and further develop your 
            knowledge and skills of statistics? Then this course is perfect for you! We will aim to enhance 
            basic understanding of statistical principles that are necessary to evaluate the scientific 
            literature in your field, to choose and perform statistical methods for your own research project, and to train you in communication with a statistical consultant when more complex types of statistical analyses are needed.
