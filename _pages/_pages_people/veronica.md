      <p>Veronica is a Postdoctoral researcher in the Biostatistics unit at Radboud UMC. Her research line focuses on mathematical and statistical modelling for infectious diseases. Her interests include developing transmission models to understand determinants and dynamics of infectious diseases in different endemic settings, as well as applying such methodologies to respond public health questions. </p>
      <p> She has experience with transmission dynamics of neglected tropical diseases (NTD) in low- and middle-income countries. During her PhD, she had the opportunity to be part of the NTD Modelling Consortium and to contribute informing policy decisions concerning the control and elimination of soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis through quantitative modelling. 
        She is currently working as a mathematical modeller for the project EQUalS: Mathematical modelling to inform an EQUitable and effective response to EpidemicS, funded by the The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (ZonMw).
