## Emerging research

**Applications of AI in medical practice**

In a significant development, pathologists are exploring the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance breast cancer treatment decisions. Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in leveraging AI to analyze digitized microscopic tissue samples. AI-driven software can accurately extract vital information from these images, enabling predictions about disease recurrence and treatment outcomes. 

In a new collaborative research project: the COMMITMENT project, funded by the KWF Dutch Cancer Society, and led by Jeroen van der Laak and Francesco Ciompi, researchers aim to apply this AI technology to benefit three distinct groups of breast cancer patients.
