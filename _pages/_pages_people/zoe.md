      <p>Zoë van den Heuvel is a PhD student in Biostatistics at the Radboudumc, with a background in mathematics and statistics. Her research is centered around the application and development of the Bayesian Federated Inference methodology, supervised by Marianne Jonker, Ton Coolen and Kit Roes. The aim of this methodology is to construct from local inferences in separate centers what would have been inferred if the data sets had been merged.
