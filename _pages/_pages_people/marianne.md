      <p>Dr. Marianne Jonker is a statistician. She is involved in consultancy, teaching and research. Her main expertise is survival analysis. She collaborates with researchers in statistical physics and oncology. Currently, her research focusses on the development of Bayesian Federated Inference (BFI). BFI can be used if data sets in separate centers can not be merged. It constructs from local inferences in separate data centers what would have been inferred had the data sets been merged.
